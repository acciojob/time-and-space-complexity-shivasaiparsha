	<h1>Time,Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is used to determine the efficency of algorithm 
		Algorithm which has the less time complexity efficincey of algorithm is high
		it define how much time required to solve the problem
		time complexity genrally determined using big O notation
	</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is used to determine how much spce occupied by the algorithm
	<b>Space Complexity</b> is also detoned in big o notation
		O(1) it takes nothing space
		O(n) it takes n elements space
		O(n^2) it takes n*n elements space
